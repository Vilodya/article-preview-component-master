### What I learned

It was a very challenging task for me. I decided to use Vue.js here, just to practice on a small project. I spent several days on it, learned a lot, and tried many things. In the end, I gained an understanding of why linters are needed, why we install packages, and so on.

### Continued development

I liked Vue and want to keep using it, and I hope the next projects will go faster.
